# Digital Gardening

Inspired by digital gardening, I want to write down thoughts as I explore, wander, refine, and share. My creative process is more cyclical. I start working on things, then procrastinate, lose interest, and find interest again. This goes on and on and sometimes I lead it towards the end. So there are a lot of unfinished things.
